## Description
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page, where it receives a `Try Again` button. Clicking this button moves it back to the left side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. As we already mentioned, there is an input form allowing the user to enter a new burger name. After sanitizing the data and making sure that it is in Title Case and does not have a definite article, the new name is added to the database, and it appears on the page in the "Undevoured" section.

It's also fully responsive, so you can eat burgers to your heart's content, even on a mobile device!

## Exciting Trivia
